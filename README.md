## When marking

If you installed the app from the play store, you may be unable to login with google but email works fine; if you installed the app from the github, you should be able to login with google.

Please ignore all the fluff in the console about 
```txt
W/Firestore: (24.1.0) [CustomClassMapper]: No setter/field for age found on class com.csc530.familytree.models.FamilyMember (fields/setters are case sensitive!)
W/Firestore: (24.1.0) [CustomClassMapper]: No setter/field for birthday found on class com.csc530.familytree.models.FamilyMember (fields/setters are case sensitive!)aidl
```
firestore is trying to set the fields of functions which don't have any
